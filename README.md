## Description

A bare-bone application that renders categories and products. The technologies and languages I used to build this application, listed below.

FrontEnd --> Visual Studio Code -- React.js 
MiddleTier/BackEnd --> Microsoft Visual Studio -- .Net 6.0 C#
BackEnd/DB --> Microsoft SQL Server -- T-SQL

Postman to test endpoints and create data

An issue I faced during building. Per coding challenge guidelines, the endpoint to retrieve products by category id should be coded as api/category/{id}. 
I ultimately changed the http path and felt this was a more of the convention way. 

In the final stages I did find bug when navigating through pages while manually changing url in browser. 
With more time and if I plan to continue building this app after submission, I would circle back to React and possibly refactor the api call functions
to address the bug.

I have also built stored procs, services, and endpoint for api calls that were not originally required for this challenge.
